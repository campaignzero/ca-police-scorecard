# ca-police-scorecard
Code and data for Campaign Zero's California police scorecard

The [California Police Scorecard](https://policescorecard.org) utilizes data on a range of policing-related issues to evaluate how each police department interacts with, and the extent to which officers are held accountable to, the communities they serve.

For more on how the entire scorecard is composed, see: [https://policescorecard.org/about](https://policescorecard.org/about).

This analysis primarily focuses on drug arrest disparities and use of deadly force by race and ethnicity. The full details, code, data, and formulas can be found in a [Jupyter notebook](ca_police_scorecard.ipynb) in this repository.
